## Making changes to Master
1. Make a new branch and switch to it
    - git checkout -b name_of_new_branch
    - You'll be committing changes to this branch
    - If you want to push the new branch to the repository: git push origin branch_name
2. Once you're ready to merge back to master check it out and merge
    - git checkout master
    - git merge name_of_new_branch
    - git branch -d new_of_new_branch  
        - this will delete old branch
