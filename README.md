## Making changes to Master Branch
1. Make a new branch and switch to it
    - git checkout -b name_of_new_branch
    - You'll be committing changes to this branch locally
2. Push your commits to remote branch
    - git push
    - IF you need set a remote upstream:
        - git push <remote-name> <branch-name>

2. Once you're ready to merge back to master branch go on create a pull request
    - Option 1: go on git hub --> Go to branches --> new pull request

# Why are we doing this?
Keep our releases to master as feature sets and keep our master clean while allowing colaborative work
